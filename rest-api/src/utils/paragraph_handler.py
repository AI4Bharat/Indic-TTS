The whole universe is friendly to us and conspires only to give the best to those who dream and work. The youth need to be enabled to become job generators from job seekers. If four things are followed - having a great aim, acquiring knowledge, hard work, and perseverance - then anything can be achieved. Where there is righteousness in the heart, there is beauty in the character. When there is beauty in the character, there is harmony in the home. When there is harmony in the home, there is order in the nation. When there is order in the nation, there is peace in the world. Great teachers emanate out of knowledge, passion and compassion. Let me define a leader. He must have vision and passion and not be afraid of any problem. Instead, he should know how to defeat it. Most importantly, he must work with integrity."
